ADPCMod - Module ADPCM library
Version 1.0 [06/03/2001] by RGR

Decompresses ADPCM compressed samples (like the ones used by MODPlug Player).

ADPCM
-----
This basic ADPCM algorithm uses a variable 16-byte prediction-error delta table to compress 8-bit mono samples, achieving a 2:1 compression ratio.

MODULES
-------
ADPCM samples can be identified in MOD files by the "ADPCM" signature on the beginning each sample data block. The format is: "ADPCM"{16 byte table}{compressed data}.

On XM files, ADPCM samples can be identified by the 0xAD byte just before the sample name, on the sample header. Normal samples have 0x00 instead. The sample's data block format is {16 byte table}{compressed data}.

DECOMPRESSING
-------------
To decompress the sample, use the DeADPCM function using the {16 byte table} and the {compressed data} as arguments. DO NOT USE .MOD FILES "ADPCM" SIGNATURE IN ANY OF THE ARGUMENTS!

KNOWN ISSUES
------------
Last byte of the decompressed sample is different from the decompression engine used by MODPlug. Have no idea why.

HISTORY
-------
1.1    [21/04/2001] - Even samples decompress bug squashed. First good version.
1.0    [06/03/2001] - First version ever. Decompresses ADPCM samples
